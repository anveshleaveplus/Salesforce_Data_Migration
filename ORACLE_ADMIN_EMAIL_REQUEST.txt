Subject: Field Officer Email Addresses - Data Migration Query

Hi [Oracle Admin Name],

Quick question about Field Officer user data in Oracle.

We're migrating Field Officer assignments to Salesforce and need email addresses for the 47 Field Officers. 

I checked the CO_USER table structure and found it doesn't have an EMAIL column. The table contains:
- USERID (MICHAELD, JEREMYT, etc.)
- USER_NAME (display names)
- MOBILE_PHONE_NO
- But no email address field

Questions:
1. Is there another table where Field Officer email addresses are stored?
2. Are emails stored in a different system (HR system, Active Directory, etc.)?
3. Should we proceed with generated emails for SIT testing?

Field Officers we need (47 total):
- MICHAELD (Michael Docherty) - Active
- JEREMYT (Jeremy Tobin) - Active  
- PETERGIU (Peter Giudice) - Inactive
- ... and 44 others

Context:
Salesforce requires unique email addresses for all users. Since CO_USER doesn't have emails, we're using generated addresses like:
- michael.docherty.sit2@leaveplus.com.au
- jeremy.tobin.sit2@leaveplus.com.au

These work fine for SIT testing, but wanted to check if real email addresses exist somewhere in the system before finalizing the approach.

Please let me know:
1. If Field Officer emails are stored anywhere in Oracle
2. If we should look in another system
3. If generated emails are acceptable for this use case

Thanks!
Anvesh

Subject: Request: Field Officer Email Addresses (47 users)

Hi Cherie,

We're setting up Field Officer user accounts in Salesforce SIT and need the actual email addresses for the 47 Field Officers.

Currently using temporary emails like:
- michael.docherty.sit2@leaveplus.com.au
- jeremy.tobin.sit2@leaveplus.com.au

But would like to update them with their real email addresses if available.

**Field Officers we need emails for:**

ACTIVE (11 officers):
- MICHAELD - Michael Docherty
- JEREMYT - Jeremy Tobin
- WJS - Jude Fernando
- AH - Anthony Harrington
- BAW - Brenda Wright
- CA - Coula Andipas
- CAA - Craig Anderson
- CJW - Colin Wilkinson
- DMG - Daryl Gibbs
- EUH - Ehsan Haque
- GJC - Geoff Concuis

INACTIVE (36 officers):
- PETERGIU - Peter Giudice
- ANDREWMAC - Andrew Mackenzie
- MATTMCPH - Matt McPhee
- ANDREWMA - Andrew Mathers
- MATTHEW.TIBBINS - Matthew Tibbins
- BENEDICTC - Benedict Chng
- ANDREWRI - Andrew Richardson
- VIDYAIYE - Vidya Iyengar
- GKM - Geoff Mackie
- JA - Joseph Antonius
- JJO - John O'Dea
- JPG - Janet Steele
- JY - June Yi
- JZ - Jim Zois
- KJK - Kevin Kristensen
- MM - Marie Martin
- MOB - Michael O'Brien
- NJ - Nikolina Josifoska
- NZ - Nicholas Ziogas
- PBB - Peter Bland
- RJK - Reg Kurce
- RS - Rukesh Sadhai
- RVO - Robert Occhipinti
- SHM - Susan Haslam
- SJJ - Sara Jenkins
- SJR - Steve Ryan
- SN - Suzi Navosailagi
- VA - Vicki Ayton
- VPL - Vic Lepore
- ANDREW.MACKENZIE - Andrew Mackenzie
- MATT.MCPHEE - Matt McPhee
- MICHAEL.DOCHERTY - Michael Docherty
- AM1 - Andrew Mathers
- JT - Jeremy Tobin
- MRD - Matthew Ridgwell-Daly
- VEENALOYA - Veena Loya

**What we need:**
A simple list with:
- Officer Code (e.g., MICHAELD)
- Officer Name
- Email Address

Format can be CSV, Excel, or just a Teams/email list.

**Why we need this:**
- Salesforce records will show proper contact information
- Notifications/emails will go to correct recipients
- Better for production readiness

**Current workaround:**
If emails aren't available, we'll keep the generated .sit2 addresses (they work fine for testing).

Please let me know if you can provide these or who would be the best person to ask.

Thanks!
Anvesh
